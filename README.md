# Fatigue-Wearable

This project enhances predictive models for physical and mental fatigue levels using a Long Short-Term Memory with Attention (LSTM-AT) algorithm, building on prior research ([Luo et al. [2020]](https://doi.org/10.1159/000512166)). We investigate the impact of LSTM-AT models on performance, explore how different fatigue label formats affect results, and assess the consequences of patient stratification. Evaluation through k-fold cross-validation yields promising preliminary results. The LSTM-AT model performs competitively or superiorly in predicting binary fatigue labels (physical fatigue: 73.56%, mental fatigue: 64.01%). However, it lacks accuracy in predicting numerical fatigue scores.  Additionally, subject-based cross-validation (patient stratification) shows a significant drop in performance, especially for mental fatigue predictions.Our findings highlight the potential of time-series forecasting models in improving fatigue prediction with wearable data, but further refinement is needed for predicting fatigue scores on novel data in future work.
